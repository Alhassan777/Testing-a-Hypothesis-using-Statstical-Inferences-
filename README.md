# Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Inference on Income Disparities

This Python project conducts a comprehensive analysis of income disparities between degree-holding Black and White individuals who underwent training. Specifically designed for technical internships, this project demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## Key Features:

### Data Import and Preprocessing:

Utilizes libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for efficient data handling and visualization.
Accesses the dataset from a Google Drive link, facilitating seamless collaboration and version control.

### Data Filtering and Segmentation:

Filters the dataset to include only degree-holding individuals who received training.
Segments the data into distinct Black and White groups for targeted analysis.

### Descriptive Statistics:

Computes essential statistics (mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation) of income for both Black and White groups.
Enhances understanding of income distribution among degree holders.

### Data Visualization:

Creates visually impactful histograms to illustrate income distribution for both groups.
Employs Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plots to visually assess the normality of income distributions.


### Statistical Inference:

Calculates a one-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in means between Black and White income.
Performs a t-test, providing a p-value and effect size metrics (Cohen's d and Hedges' g).
Insightful for making data-driven decisions on income disparities.

### Power Analysis:

Visualizes statistical power using a graphical representation.
Determines the power of the test, critical for understanding the reliability of the statistical results.
